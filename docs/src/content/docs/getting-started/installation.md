# Installation Guide

excel-to-json can be installed in several ways depending on your platform and preferences. Choose the method that works best for you.

## Prerequisites

### For Building from Source
If you plan to install from source or using Cargo, you'll need:
- **Rust**: Version 1.70 or later ([Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Cargo**: Comes with Rust installation

### For Pre-built Binaries
- No prerequisites required!

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Install with Cargo (Recommended)

The easiest way to install excel-to-json is using Cargo, Rust's package manager:

```bash
cargo install excel-to-json
```

This will:
1. Download the latest version from crates.io
2. Compile it for your platform
3. Install the binary to `~/.cargo/bin/`

Make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
# Add to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

### Method 2: Download Pre-built Binary

Download the latest release for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ryan-ajility/excel-to-json/releases) page.

#### macOS
```bash
# Download the binary (replace VERSION with actual version)
curl -L https://github.com/ryan-ajility/excel-to-json/releases/download/VERSION/excel-to-json-macos -o excel-to-json

# Make it executable
chmod +x excel-to-json

# Move to a directory in your PATH
sudo mv excel-to-json /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Linux
```bash
# Download the binary (replace VERSION with actual version)
wget https://github.com/ryan-ajility/excel-to-json/releases/download/VERSION/excel-to-json-linux -O excel-to-json

# Make it executable
chmod +x excel-to-json

# Move to a directory in your PATH
sudo mv excel-to-json /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Windows
1. Download `excel-to-json-windows.exe` from the releases page
2. Rename to `excel-to-json.exe`
3. Add the directory containing the executable to your PATH

### Method 3: Build from Source

Clone the repository and build with Cargo:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryan-ajility/excel-to-json.git
cd excel-to-json

# Build and install
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```

### Method 4: Using Homebrew (macOS)

If you're on macOS and have Homebrew installed:

```bash
# Add the tap (if available)
brew tap ryan-ajility/excel-to-json

# Install
brew install excel-to-json
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that excel-to-json is working:

```bash
# Check version
excel-to-json --version

# Display help
excel-to-json --help
```

You should see output similar to:
```

WORKDIR /app
RUN cargo install excel-to-json

FROM debian:bookworm-slim
